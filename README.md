# Figma

How to use with Figma:

Option 1:
Add this sketch file to your library and insert components into your project files.

Option 2:
Just copy and paste components directly to your project files.

*Note: Copy-pasting components across multiple Figma files will detach all nested symbols. So working directly on this file is recommended.
